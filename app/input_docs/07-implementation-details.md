SmolRAG's codebase is organized in a modular, maintainable structure that separates concerns and promotes reusability. The main components are organized as follows:

- **app/**: The main package containing all SmolRAG functionality
  - **smol_rag.py**: The core class that orchestrates the entire system
  - **chunking.py**: Document chunking strategies
  - **openai_llm.py**: Interface to OpenAI's API
  - **vector_store.py**: Vector database implementation
  - **graph_store.py**: Knowledge graph implementation
  - **kv_store.py**: Key-value store implementation
  - **prompts.py**: System prompts for various operations
  - **utilities.py**: General utility functions
  - **logger.py**: Logging configuration
  - **definitions.py**: Constants and path definitions
  - **evaluation/**: Evaluation framework
- **api/**: FastAPI implementation for the REST API
  - **main.py**: API endpoints and request handling

This organization follows the principle of separation of concerns, with each module responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality.

- `__init__()`: Initializes the RAG system with configurable components
- `import_documents()`: Imports documents from the input directory
- `query()`: Performs vector search query
- `local_kg_query()`: Performs local knowledge graph query
- `global_kg_query()`: Performs global knowledge graph query
- `hybrid_kg_query()`: Performs hybrid knowledge graph query
- `mix_query()`: Performs mix query (combines vector search and knowledge graph)
- `remove_document_by_id()`: Removes a document from the system

The class is designed to be flexible, allowing users to customize various components through dependency injection in the constructor.

- `degree(name)`: Gets the degree (number of connections) of a node
- `save()`: Saves the graph to disk

The implementation leverages NetworkX's capabilities while providing a simplified interface tailored to SmolRAG's needs.

### **7. Key-Value Store Implementation**

The `JsonKvStore` class in `kv_store.py` provides a simple key-value store for caching and metadata:

**Key Methods**:
- `__init__(path)`: Initializes the store with a path
- `add(key, value)`: Adds a key-value pair to the store
- `get_by_key(key)`: Gets a value by key
- `has(key)`: Checks if a key exists in the store
- `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the store
- `equal(key, value)`: Checks if a key's value equals the given value
- `save()`: Saves the store to disk

This lightweight implementation provides efficient storage for metadata and caching, with JSON serialization for persistence.

### **8. System Prompts**

The `prompts.py` file contains carefully crafted prompts for various operations:

**Key Functions**:
- `get_query_system_prompt(context)`: Gets the system prompt for vector search queries
- `excerpt_summary_prompt(full_doc, excerpt)`: Gets the prompt for summarizing excerpts
- `get_extract_entities_prompt(excerpt)`: Gets the prompt for extracting entities and relationships
- `get_high_low_level_keywords_prompt(query)`: Gets the prompt for extracting high and low-level keywords
- `get_kg_query_system_prompt(context)`: Gets the system prompt for knowledge graph queries

### **12. Logging and Error Handling**

Logging and error handling are implemented throughout the system:

**Logging**:
- The `logger.py` file configures the logging system
- The `set_logger()` function sets up logging with a specified file
- Log messages are categorized by level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.)
- Performance metrics and processing steps are logged for monitoring

**Error Handling**:
- Try-except blocks are used to catch and handle exceptions
- Graceful degradation ensures the system continues even if individual steps fail
- Detailed error messages help with debugging
- The API includes proper error responses with status codes and messages

This robust logging and error handling ensures that the system is reliable and maintainable.

### **13. Data Flow and Processing Pipeline**

The data flow in SmolRAG follows well-defined processing pipelines:

**Document Ingestion Pipeline**:
1. Documents are read from the input directory
2. Each document is chunked into excerpts
3. Each excerpt is summarized
4. Excerpts and summaries are embedded
5. Entities and relationships are extracted
6. All data is stored in the appropriate stores

**Query Processing Pipeline**:
1. The query is received and validated
2. The appropriate query method is called based on the query type
3. The query is processed according to the specific pipeline for that query type
4. The results are formatted and returned

These pipelines ensure consistent processing and make it easy to understand and modify the system's behavior.
