Here are some strategies for query type selection:- **Question Analysis**: Analyze the question to determine if it's about specific entities (local KG), broader concepts (global KG), or a mix of both.\n- **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a simpler query type and move to more complex ones if the initial response is insufficient.\n- **Domain-Specific Defaults**: For certain domains or document types, some query types may consistently perform better.\n- **Response Time Requirements**: Consider the trade-off between response quality and response time based on your use case.\n- **Computational Resource Constraints**: If resources are limited, prioritize more efficient query types.",
